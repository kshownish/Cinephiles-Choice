# üé¨ Genre-Based Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system built using a dataset of **Telugu-language films**, designed to help users discover movies based on their preferred genres. This project leverages NLP, TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity, and a simple interactive GUI using Tkinter.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to solve the problem of movie discovery within the context of **Telugu cinema**, which is often underrepresented in global datasets. Instead of relying on collaborative filtering, it uses **content-based filtering** ‚Äî focusing on the `Genre` and `Overview` fields of movies to recommend similar ones.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Recommend top-N movies that are similar in genre to a given movie.
- Provide an intuitive GUI for testing recommendations.
- Focus on **Telugu movies** with support for genre-specific filtering and content-based suggestions.

---

## üß† Why Genre-Based Filtering?

- Genres are a natural and intuitive grouping for movie preferences.
- Enables recommendations for lesser-known or new movies, as long as genre info is available.
- Avoids cold-start problems associated with user-based systems.

## üîç Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Handled missing values in `Year`, `Certificate`, `Genre`, and `Overview`.
- Cleaned irrelevant columns (`Unnamed: 0`) and converted datatypes.
- Normalized `Runtime`, removed or imputed unknowns.
- Ensured consistency in certificate labels.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plotted distributions of runtime, year, certificate types, genre counts.
- Analyzed outliers and trends in rating and runtime.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Transformed multi-label `Genre` into string corpus.
- Cleaned and tokenized the `Overview` text.
- Used `TF-IDF Vectorizer` for both `Genre` and `Overview` fields.

### 4. Model & Recommendation Logic
- Calculated **cosine similarity** for:
  - Overview vectors (for thematic similarity)
  - Genre vectors (for categorical similarity)
- Defined two primary recommendation modes:
  - **Genre-based Top-N** recommendations.
  - **You May Also Like** ‚Äî based on overview similarity + rating.

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI (Tkinter-based)

A lightweight graphical interface built with Python's `tkinter`, which allows users to:
- Select a genre from a dropdown.
- View Top-10 recommended Telugu movies.
- Click on a movie to see:
  - Overview, Certificate, Runtime, Rating.
- Also see **"You May Also Like"** suggestions based on thematic content.
